# Chess

Experiments with Chess and Chess AI. Everything is implemented in TS
with a single dependency:
[snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) (a virtual DOM
library).

## Kudos

Big shoutout to [lichess](https://lichess.org/), the [Chess
Programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page), and
[chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js), all of which served as
a point of reference for this project.

The piece set is [caliente](https://github.com/avi-0/caliente).
